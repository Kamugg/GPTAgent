# GPTAgent

GPTAgent is an OpenAI's API wrapper thet I built for practice. For the moment the wrapper allows the user to send a message to their preferred model and receive its answer. In the project I also included ```chat_test.py``` that shows how to interact with the wrapper while also giving some specific instructions regarding its behavior.
